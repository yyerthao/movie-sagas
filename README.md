# MOVIE SAGA

_Duration: 30 hours

Create an application where user can click on movie upon landing page with movies listed. Upon clicking on specified movie, user will get directed to a new view with the details of the movie selected. User will also have option to add their own personal choice of movie, url, and description. 




### Prerequisites


## Installation

1. Create a database named `your database name`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
